            This spring Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne called out the auto industry for the staggering amount of money it wastes in the design and manufacture of cars. His solution is based on classic business principles: consolidate and eliminate redundancy. Local Motors CEO Jay Rogers perceives the same challenge, but he's attacking it from a completely different direction.

            Perhaps you’re even thinking about what to neatly wrap and put under the tree this year. Or maybe you’re at a total loss of what to get for your friends and family. Finding unique gifts can be tough and frustrating, but 3D printing can help you out with that. Make gifts that you can customize and personalize to wow all your loved ones this holiday season… and for any other occasions to come.

            3D printing is used by designers, hobbyists, teachers, and kids, to make toys, prototypes, home decor, Minecraft models, jewelry – the list is truly endless! You’re hearing a lot about 3D printing lately, right? As a designer, you probably see it everywhere — and while 3D printers aren’t going to become as commonplace as computers any time soon, they are likely going to continue to grow in use and popularity.

            When the doors open on May 5 for Manus x Machina, the Met Costume Institute’s Spring exhibition, visitors will be treated to 90 otherworldly high-fashion garments, including many striking items made with 3D printing. These outfits—a layered, cross-hatched suit from Chanel's 2015-16 Autumn/Winter haute couture line, an exotic, infinitely complex polyamide top in the Dutch designer Iris Van Herpen's Spring/Summer 2010 collection.
